# RankMine Health Monitor
Daily crawler for [RankMine](https://rankmine.blogspot.com) – 106 SEO tools.
Opens GitHub issue only if a tool breaks (zero spam).

## How it works
- GitHub Action runs every night 2 AM IST
- Crawls every tool page → checks status + soft errors
- Opens issue only if ≥ 1 URL broken
- You fix → close issue → re-run → compound health forever!

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
node health.js

Issue opens → fix listed URLs → close → compound health forever!
